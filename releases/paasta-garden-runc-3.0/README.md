# Garden-runC Release

A [BOSH](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bosh/) release for deploying
[Guardian](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/guardian).

Guardian is a simple single-host [OCI](https://opencontainers.org/) container
manager. It implements the [Garden](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/garden/) API
which is used in [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/).

## Getting started

Clone it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry/garden-runc-release
cd garden-runc-release
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Running

**Note**: If you are transitioning from garden-linux-release to garden-runc-release, please read the transition doc [here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/garden-runc-release/blob/master/docs/transition-from-garden-linux.md).

The easiest way to run Garden-runC is to deploy it with [BOSH
Lite](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-lite), a local development
environment for [BOSH](https://bosh.io). Once you have  set up bosh-lite (follow the instructions in the bosh-lite repo), just deploy like any bosh release, e.g:

~~~~
cd garden-runc-release # if you're not already there
bosh deployment manifests/bosh-lite.yml
bosh create release && bosh upload release && bosh deploy
~~~~

You can retrieve the address of the Garden-runC server by running `bosh vms`.
It will be `10.244.16.6` if using the provided bosh-lite manifest in [manifests/bosh-lite.yml](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/garden-runc-release/blob/master/manifests/bosh-lite.yml). The server
port defaults to `7777`.

### Usage

The easiest way to start creating containers is to use the
[`gaol`](https://github.com/contraband/gaol) command line client.

e.g. `gaol -t 10.244.16.6:7777 create -n my-container`

For more advanced use cases, you'll need to use the [Garden
client](https://godoc.org/code.cloudfoundry.org/garden#Client)
package for Golang.

### Rootless containers

Garden has experimental support for running containers without requiring root
privileges. Take a look at the [rootless-containers.md](docs/rootless-containers.md) doc for further info.

## Contributing

In order to help us extend Garden-runC, we recommend opening a Github issue to
describe the proposed features or changes. We also welcome pull requests.

You can use other distributions or OS X for development since a good chunk of
the unit tests work across alternative platforms, and you can run platform
specific tests in a VM using [Concourse CI](https://concourse.ci/).

In order to contribute to the project you should have the following installed:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Distributed version control system
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install#install) - The Go programming
   language
- [Direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv) - Environment management
- [Gosub](https://github.com/vito/gosub) - Gosub is a submodule based dependency manager for Go
- [Fly CLI](https://github.com/concourse/fly) - Concourse CLI
- [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) - Virtualization box
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) - Portable dev environment

Garden-runC uses git submodules to maintain its dependencies and components.
Garden-runC's components currently are:

* [Garden](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/garden) found under
   `src/code.cloudfoundry.org/garden` is the API server and client.
* [Guardian](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/guardian) found under
   `src/code.cloudfoundry.org/guardian` is the Garden backend.
* [Garden Shed](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/garden-shed) found under
   `src/code.cloudfoundry.org/garden-shed` downloads and manages
   root filesystems.
* [GATS](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/garden-integration-tests)
   found under `src/code.cloudfoundry.org/garden-integration-tests`
   are the cross-backend integration tests of Garden.

Set your `$GOPATH` to the checked out directory, or use Direnv to do this, as
below:

```bash
direnv allow
```

### Running the tests

[Concourse CI](https://concourse.ci/) is used for running Garden-runC tests
in a VM. It provides the [Fly CLI](https://github.com/concourse/fly) for
Linux and MacOSX. Concourse has a pre-built Vagrant box for VirtualBox. You
can create a new instance by executing the following commands:

```bash
mkdir concourse-lite
cd concourse-lite
vagrant init concourse/lite
vagrant up
```

Note: The concourse-lite VM must have at least 6GB of RAM. If it has less than
6GB, you'll start to see tests failing with 'out of disk' errors.
The following can be copied to the Vagrantfile to assign the recommended
resources:

```
config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |v|
  v.memory = 6144
  v.cpus = 4
end
```

Open [http://192.168.100.4:8080](http://192.168.100.4:8080) in a web browser
and download the [Fly CLI](http://concourse.ci/fly-cli.html) from the
bottom-right corner. Place the `fly` binary somewhere on your `$PATH`.

The tests use the [Ginkgo](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/) BDD testing
framework.

Assuming you have configured a Concourse and installed Ginkgo, you can run all
the tests by executing `./scripts/test`.

#### Unit tests

If you are using Linux based operation system like Ubuntu, you should install
[Aufs](http://aufs.sourceforge.net/) if you want to run tests on your local
machine.

```bash
sudo apt-get install linux-image-extra-$(uname -r)
sudo modprobe aufs
```

The unit tests can be executed without Concourse CLI by running `ginkgo -r`
command for any of the components:

```bash
# Running Garden unit tests
cd src/code.cloudfoundry.org/garden
ginkgo -r

# Running Guardian unit tests
cd src/code.cloudfoundry.org/guardian
ginkgo -r
```

#### Integration tests

The integration tests can be executed in Concourse CI by using Fly CLI and
executing `./scripts/remote-fly`:

```bash
# Running Guardian tests
./scripts/remote-fly ci/guardian.yml

# Running Garden Shed tests
./scripts/remote-fly ci/nested-shed-tests.yml

# Running Garden integration tests in Concourse CI
./scripts/remote-fly ci/gats.yml
```

#### Comitting code

Write code in a submodule:

```bash
cd src/code.cloudfoundry.org/guardian # for example
git checkout master
git pull
# test, code, test..
git commit
git push
```

Commit the changes, run the tests, and create a bump commit:

```bash
# from the garden-runc directory
./scripts/test-and-bump # or just ./scripts/bump if you've already run the tests
```

#### Execute command in container using runc

- Create a container with handle &lt;handle&gt;
- Log in to the host OS with root privileges
- Go to container depot directory
```
cd /var/vcap/data/garden/depot/<handle>
```
- Execute process in container
```
/var/vcap/packages/runc/bin/runc exec <handle> <command>
```
